2) Update parseProjections (src/lib/projections.ts)

Add them into the keys list so they get parsed:

const keys = [
  "pass_att","pass_comp","pass_yd","pass_td","pass_int",
  "rush_att","rush_yd","rush_td",
  "rec","rec_yd","rec_td","fum_lost","two_pt",
  "xpm","xpa","fgm_0_19","fgm_20_29","fgm_30_39","fgm_40_49","fgm_50p",
  "sacks","defs_int","defs_fum_rec","defs_td","safety","blk_kick","ret_td","pts_allowed"
];

3) Update the Scorer (src/lib/scoring.ts)

Add those fields into the offense scoring function:

export function scoreOff(stats: NumRec, scoring: LeagueScoring) {
  const passAtt = stats.pass_att ?? 0;
  const passComp = stats.pass_comp ?? 0;
  const passYd = stats.pass_yd ?? 0;
  const passTd = stats.pass_td ?? 0;
  const passInt = stats.pass_int ?? 0;
  const rushAtt = stats.rush_att ?? 0;
  const rushYd = stats.rush_yd ?? 0;
  const rushTd = stats.rush_td ?? 0;
  const rec = stats.rec ?? 0;
  const recYd = stats.rec_yd ?? 0;
  const recTd = stats.rec_td ?? 0;
  const fumLost = stats.fum_lost ?? 0;
  const twoPt = stats.two_pt ?? 0;

  const pts =
    passAtt * g(scoring, "pass_att", 0) +
    passComp * g(scoring, "pass_cmp", 0) +
    passYd * g(scoring, "pass_yd", 0.04) +
    passTd * g(scoring, "pass_td", 4) +
    passInt * g(scoring, "pass_int", -1) +
    rushAtt * g(scoring, "rush_att", 0) +
    rushYd * g(scoring, "rush_yd", 0.1) +
    rushTd * g(scoring, "rush_td", 6) +
    rec * g(scoring, "rec", 1) +
    recYd * g(scoring, "rec_yd", 0.1) +
    recTd * g(scoring, "rec_td", 6) +
    fumLost * g(scoring, "fum_lost", -2) +
    twoPt * g(scoring, "two_pt", 2);

  return pts;
}


pass_att is multiplied by the league’s pass_att weight if it exists (most leagues = 0).

pass_comp uses pass_cmp weight.

rush_att uses rush_att weight.

4) Notes

This doesn’t change functionality for leagues that don’t use completions/attempts, since defaults = 0.

If a league has scoring like +0.25 per completion or -0.1 per incompletion, the Sleeper scoring_settings keys will cover it (pass_cmp, pass_incmp, pass_att).

With rush_att, you’re covered if a league awards points per carry (common in “PPC” formats).
